# Inside Python Dict - an explorable explanation

This repository contains the code for an explorable explanation of python dicts. 

## Code

The code is quite messy, the build system works on my laptop but might not work on your machine. That's all fixable, but I am not sure if there is any interest from people in using the actual code. If so, let me know, I'll clean things up a bit and write an overview of the codebase. 

Meanwhile, try running `npm install && npm start` and see if if works. 

Bugfixes will be gladly accepted.
